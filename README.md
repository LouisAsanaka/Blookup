# Blookup
### Compare book prices just by scanning its barcode!

- App is written for **iOS 11.3** since I don't own an iOS 12 device.
- Right now, it mainly compares Amazon book prices to prices on Taiwanese online bookstores by scraping each website for the price data
- This is my first legitimate app, so the codebase probably looks like spaghetti
- The UI is very bland, but I think its enough to allow the app to be usable

Todos:
- Modify the code to make it work on the latest iOS version (iOS 12)
- Clean up the code
- Figure out how to make the view controllers less cluttered
